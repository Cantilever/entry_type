# Entry Type #

A dropdown fieldtype that shows/hides other fields on the publish page.

This can be used to create a Tumblr-like experience. For example, you first add a list of "types" to the Entry Type field: Link, Video, Image, etc. Then you create custom field(s) for each of those types for that field group. Then you can associate certain fields in that group to types, and when you select a type in the dropdown, those associated fields will show, and the others will hide.
